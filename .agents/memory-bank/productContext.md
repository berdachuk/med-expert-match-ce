# Product Context

## Core Capabilities (6 Use Cases)

1. **Specialist Matching (UC-1)** — Match a medical case to the best specialist using three-signal scoring: vector similarity (cosine distance on case embeddings), graph proximity (doctor-case relationships in Apache AGE), and historical performance (ClinicalExperience outcomes). Results are ranked, scored 0–100, with explainability signal breakdown.

2. **Second Opinion (UC-2)** — Independent specialist review with alternative differential diagnosis; same matching pipeline with different presentation context.

3. **Queue Prioritization (UC-3)** — Auto-prioritize consultation queues by urgency (not FIFO): HIGH/URGENT cases first, MEDIUM next, LOW/ROUTINE last. Priority scores derived from urgency level + case complexity + time sensitivity.

4. **Network Analytics (UC-4)** — Expertise network visualization and analytics: graph-based discovery of sub-specialist clusters, aggregate metrics per department, expertise coverage gaps. Powered by Apache AGE graph queries.

5. **Decision Support (UC-5)** — AI-powered clinical decision support: case analysis with entity extraction, ICD-10 coding, differential diagnosis, evidence retrieval from PubMed + local documents, treatment recommendations.

6. **Regional Routing (UC-6)** — Multi-facility routing optimization: match case complexity to facility capability, geographic proximity scoring, capacity-aware recommendations.

## Retrieval Scoring

Three-signal weighted average (or optional Reciprocal Rank Fusion k=60):
- Vector similarity → 40% default weight (configurable)
- Graph proximity → 30% default weight
- Historical outcomes → 30% default weight

Optional semantic re-ranking via `RerankingService` (disabled by default).

## Feature Flags

Toggleable in `application.yml`: `document-ingestion`, `graph-rag`, `agent-skills`, `evaluation`, `semantic-reranking`, `case-analysis`, `auto-memory`.

## Non-Goals

- Real patient data (synthetic-only for MVP)
- Production scale-out
- Multi-tenancy
- HIPAA certification (follows HIPAA principles, no formal cert)
- Patient-facing apps

## Traceability (seed)

Stable IDs follow `.agents/skills/bdd-traceability/SKILL.md` (REQ-###, SCN-###, TEST-###, DEC-###, RISK-###).
Rows marked **provisional** are not yet linked to a verified test artifact; see `.agents/memory-bank/activeContext.md` "Traceability gaps".
